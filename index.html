        <center><p style="line-height: 1.5em;">hi my love ♡︎. you might be wondering why i made this, but i just wanted to show you how much i love you. <br> i appreciate you so much and you make my day so much better, even if it's just a text. and i think the time we spent apart only strengthened that. during the time that you were on vacation, i had such a hard time coping because i missed you way too much. i found myself checking my phone every few minutes to see if i got a notification from you. and when i did, i felt so happy. (i'm still like this even after you came back from japan, don't worry.)<br> before i met you, i promised to myself that i would never fall in love with a man ever again. but out of nowhere, you came into my life. you are different than everyone else. you are so special. ever since we started talking, i had something to look forward to. you are my motivation, and honestly i accomplished a lot. i am so grateful to have you. <br> right now, i know we don't know each other that well. but i do know that i love you so much, beyond what words can describe. i want to spend as much time as possible with you to get to know you better. during this time, i hope to make so many memories that i will never forget. even now, i cherish each and every moment that we had together, and i hope it continues to be this way.</p></center>
